How to get your device to be supported
---
In order for us to be able to support your device, some criterias have to be met:
- the chipset has to be 67xx (no, we really don't support any 65xx! There's no point in asking)
- the stock software has to be Android 6.0 or higher
- the kernel source code of the device has to be available (of -your- exact model, not something supposedly similar)
- we need to have this device ourselves to test! We are not going to build something blindly and rely on someone else to test it! you could:
  * buy a used/new device and ship to us
  * collect money in the community for us to buy a new/used device ourselves
  * contact the vendor of your phone and ask them to cooperate with us
  * be creative...

don't waste your and our time by asking to support your device, if one of these criterias can't be met.
